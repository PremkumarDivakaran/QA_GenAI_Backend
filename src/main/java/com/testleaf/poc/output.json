The user provided an example with positive test cases categorized into Functional, Performance, and Security. Now, I have to think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand the user story thoroughly. The user wants to reset their password, which implies they can't access their account. So, the system should allow them to reset it through some mechanism, probably via email.\n\nThe user specified that the test cases must be positive only, so I don't need to consider negative or edge cases. They also want the test cases categorized into Functional, Performance, and Security. Each test case needs to have specific sections: Test Case ID, Title, Preconditions, Steps, Expected Results, Test Data, and Priority.\n\nLooking at the example provided, I see that each category has a few test cases. For Functional, there are cases like successful reset, reset without an account, and multiple requests. For Performance, it's about handling many requests. For Security, it's about not allowing old links and using secure connections.\n\nI should start by brainstorming all possible positive scenarios for each category. For Functional, I can think of the basic reset process, what happens if the user enters the wrong email, or if they request the reset multiple times. For Performance, maybe testing how the system handles a large number of simultaneous reset requests. For Security, ensuring that the reset link expires after use or a certain time, and that it's only usable once.\n\nWait, but the user said to include only positive tests. So I shouldn't include negative scenarios like wrong email. Hmm, maybe I should focus on the system's correct behavior under normal circumstances.\n\nLet me outline possible test cases:\n\nFunctional:\n1. Successful password reset after requesting via email.\n2. Receiving a reset link when the email exists.\n3. Ability to reset password multiple times without issues.\n4. Proper error message when email doesn't exist (but this is negative, so maybe not needed here).\n\nWait, the user said only positive, so maybe I should avoid cases where the email doesn't exist. Instead, focus on when the email does exist and the process works smoothly.\n\nPerformance:\n1. Handling multiple password reset requests efficiently without delay.\n2. Ensuring the system doesn't crash under a high volume of reset requests.\n\nSecurity:\n1. Reset link expiration after a certain period.\n2. Reset link can only be used once.\n3. Using HTTPS for reset link to ensure security.\n\nWait, the example had test cases for each category, so I can structure mine similarly.\n\nI should assign each test case an ID, a title, preconditions, steps, expected results, test data, and priority. The priority can be High, Medium, or Low based on importance.\n\nLet me start drafting each test case.\n\nFor Functional:\n- Test Case 1: Successful password reset via email.\n- Test Case 2: Receiving reset link when email exists.\n- Test Case 3: Handling multiple reset requests.\n\nFor Performance:\n- Test Case 4: System handles multiple reset requests without performance issues.\n- Test Case 5: Quick response time for reset requests.\n\nFor Security:\n- Test Case 6: Reset link expires after use.\n- Test Case 7: Reset link is secure (HTTPS).\n- Test Case 8: Reset link can't be reused.\n\nWait, but the example had 9 test cases, so maybe I can add more. Let me think of additional positive scenarios.\n\nMaybe for Functional, testing the reset process with different email providers or ensuring that the password meets complexity requirements after reset. But since it's positive, maybe just the basic flow.\n\nI think I have enough to structure the test cases now. I'll make sure each one follows the required format and is categorized correctly.\n</think>\n\nHere is the structured presentation of test cases for the user story, focusing on positive scenarios and categorized into Functional, Performance, and Security:\n\n### Functional Test Cases\n\n| Test Case ID | Title | Preconditions | Steps | Expected Results | Test Data | Priority |\n|--------------|-------|---------------|-------|-------------------|-----------|----------|\n| FT-001       | Successful Password Reset via Email | User has an account and forgets password. | 1. User clicks \"Forgot Password.\" 2. Enters valid email. 3. Receives reset link. 4. Creates new password. | Password reset successful; user logs in. | Valid email, new password meets criteria. | High |\n| FT-002       | Receive Reset Link with Valid Email | User has an account. | 1. Click \"Forgot Password.\" 2. Enter registered email. | Reset link sent to email. | Registered email. | Medium |\n| FT-003       | Multiple Reset Requests | User requests reset multiple times. | 1. Request reset, receive link. 2. Request again. | Latest link works; previous links expire. | Valid email. | Low |\n\n### Performance Test Cases\n\n| Test Case ID | Title | Preconditions | Steps | Expected Results | Test Data | Priority |\n|--------------|-------|---------------|-------|-------------------|-----------|----------|\n| PT-001       | Handle Multiple Reset Requests | High user traffic. | 1. Simulate many reset requests. | All requests processed without delay. | 1000 simultaneous requests. | High |\n| PT-002       | Quick Response for Reset Requests | High load on server. | 1. Measure response time. | Response under 2 seconds. | 500 requests. | Medium |\n\n### Security Test Cases\n\n| Test Case ID | Title | Preconditions | Steps | Expected Results | Test Data | Priority |\n|--------------|-------|---------------|-------|-------------------|-----------|----------|\n| ST-001       | Reset Link Expiration | User requests reset. | 1. Use link after 1 hour. | Error message; link expired. | Valid email. | High |\n| ST-002       | Secure Reset Link | User requests reset. | 1. Check URL protocol. | URL uses HTTPS. | Valid email. | Medium |\n| ST-003       | One-Time Use of Reset Link | User resets password. | 1. Use link again. | Error message; link used. | Valid email. | Medium |\n\nThese test cases ensure that the password reset feature functions correctly, performs well under stress, and maintains security standards."
